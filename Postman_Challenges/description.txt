To view your challenges status in multi-user mode, make sure you have registered as a challenger using a `POST` request to `/challenger` and are including an `X-CHALLENGER` header in all your requests.

Then view the challenges in the GUI by visiting `/gui/challenges/{GUID}`, where `{GUID}` is the value in the `X-CHALLENGER` header.

Challenger sessions are purged from the server memory after 10 minutes of inactivity. To restore your session progress issue an API request with the X-CHALLENGER header (note this will restore the completion state of challenges, but not the data you were using)
